## CVPR2024, Semantic-aware SAM for Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation
SAPNet(highlight paper)
--------------

SAPNet a newly proposed method for point-prompted instance segmentation tasks is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 

To date, It implements the following algorithms:
